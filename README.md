### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Roth, currently a sophomore in Lander College for Men pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Science degeree. 
I am currently heavily ninvolved in learning object-oriented programming, with a focus on Java.
Additionally, I am learning about front and back end web development, with an emphasis on MySQL database connections.

I'm looking for a part-time summer internship at the moment, which I can do alongside summer classes. I'm interested in any interships in the computer science field.
